# plant_disease
This project implements a plant leaf disease detection system using deep learning with PyTorch and EfficientNet-B3. The system is capable of training a model on a dataset of plant leaf images and then using the trained model to predict diseases on new images through a simple web-based user interface built with Streamlit.
